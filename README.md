# Relational Database for a Fictional Tutoring Company
**Jacob Hillman, Victoria Vo, Maya Muralidhar**

This database was produced in collaboration with two other computer science students (Victoria Vo and Maya Muralidhar) for a class assignment in Database Concepts (CSE 3330 at Southern Methodist University).

## Tech
This database is built on a LAMP stack hosted on an AWS EC-2 instance. We used MySQL to build and query the database. We used the [Slim Framework](https://www.slimframework.com/) to connect our database to the front end using a routes file in PHP. The front end was under development by another team, but was unfortunately never completed. 

## Personal Contributions (Jacob Hillman)
* Designed the structure of the database and created the Entity Relationship Diagram. The database is purposefully de-normalized to allow for easier access to data. 
* Wrote a handful of routes, including get, post, and update requests.
